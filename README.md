# omarchy-local-ai-dashboard
Monitor and control local AI model services like ollama and llama.cpp from the Omarchy bar. Start and stop systemd background services, view available models with current status, monitor CPU/GPU/DRAM/VRAM usage, stream debug output via a new terminal session, and open config files directly in nvim.

It provides a unified interface for various local backends—including `ollama` and `llama-server`—allowing you to inspect models, adjust service setups, stream terminal logs, and enforce single-service resource isolation. Support for `vLLM` is a planned feature.

This project is an extended derivative work based on `omarchy-ollama-status` by LinuxGamerUK.

## Plugin Identification

- **Plugin Name:** `local-ai-dashboard`
- **Full Identifier:** `kevano.local-ai-dashboard`
- **Target Platform:** Omarchy 4 (Quattro / Quickshell Engine)

---

## Project Structure

The plugin is split into a `Dashboard.qml` shell that owns all shared state
(backend selection, cursor/keyboard navigation, `Service` instances) plus a set
of reusable UI components and per-section files. Each section is "state-in /
signal-out": it receives data as properties and reports interactions back as
signals, so the shell remains the single source of truth.

```

`manifest.json` points the bar at `BarWidget.qml` (`entryPoints.barWidget`), which
registers a `Controller` that loads `Dashboard.qml` on demand. Both the
`Service.qml` model and the `qs.Ui` panel primitives (`Panel`,
`KeyboardPanel`, `CursorSurface`, etc.) are reused across the sections.

## Features & Architecture

- **Dual systemd scope model:** ollama runs as a system-wide daemon (system instance, managed via `pkexec`), while llama.cpp runs as a per-user service (user instance, self-provisioned on first start with no root or polkit required). Both can run side-by-side independently.
- **Multi-Service Selection Bar:** Displays all installed or configured local AI services at a glance. Easily switch the target view without affecting active background processes.
- **Single-Active Service Enforcer:** Activating a service automatically initiates a graceful shutdown of any currently running backend and waits for complete resource/VRAM forfeit before starting the target engine.
- **Single-panel layout:** Hero cards at top for backend selection + power toggle, followed by a status/details grid and a model inventory list — all in one scrollable panel.
- **Interactive Terminal Debugging:** One-click action to launch a terminal attached to live systemd or process logs.
- **Inline Neovim Configuration:** View service config file locations and open them directly in Neovim for editing.

## Interface Layout

### Header: Service Selector

The top header presents a horizontal row of available local services. Each service is represented by a single-column, two-row element:

```


+--------------+--------------+
| ollama       | llama.cpp    |
| RUNNING      | STOPPED      |
+--------------+--------------+

```

- **Selected View:** The currently selected service name is rendered in bold, bright text. Non-selected services are dimmed.
- **Interactive Selection:** Clicking any service column changes the active tab focus below to that service. Inspecting a service in this manner does not alter its running state.

---

### Lower Section: Three-Part Vertical Layout

The lower section is divided into three stacked components in a single scrollable panel.

#### Hero Section: Backend Cards + Power Toggle

Two clickable backend selector cards display the current status of each available service, alongside a power toggle switch for the active backend.

#### Service Details Grid

Displays operational information for the currently selected service in a two-column grid:

- **Status:** `RUNNING` or `STOPPED`
- **Version:** Version string reported by the engine
- **API:** The host and port the service is serving on (shown when running)
- **Latency:** API response latency in milliseconds (shown when reachable, color-coded)
- **Since:** Timestamp of when the service was started
- **Configure [Backend]:** Opens the service's config file in Neovim for editing
- **View debug output:** Spawns a terminal attached to live systemd logs (only available when running)
- **Create [Backend] config file:** Generates the default config file (only shown when no config exists)

#### Model Inventory

Displays an itemized list of all local models recognized by the selected service engine. When the service is running, loaded models appear at the top with memory telemetry:

- **Model Name:** Currently active model identifier
- **Memory:** Full process footprint — measured DRAM working set added to measured per-service VRAM (`nvidia-smi` on NVIDIA, `rocm-smi` on AMD). Reclaimable file/page cache (the mmap'd `.gguf`) is deliberately excluded so the number reflects committed memory rather than the cached model file.
- **Resource Split:** Measured CPU (DRAM) / GPU (VRAM) share of that total: `CPU% = DRAM / (DRAM + VRAM)`, `GPU% = 100 - CPU%`.
- **Available models list:** Below loaded models, all available models are listed with indicators for cloud models and running status.

---

## Planned Features

- **vLLM support:** Backend integration for the vLLM inference engine.
- **Context Meter:** Visual representation of total context used versus total context allocated for the loaded model.

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone this repository into your Omarchy plugins directory:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/omarchy-local-ai-dashboard.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/omarchy-local-ai-dashboard.git) ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/local-ai-dashboard

```

2. Register the plugin by adding it to a `bar.layout` region in your Omarchy 4 configuration file (`~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`). For example, the right region:
```json
{
  "bar": {
    "layout": {
      "right": [
        { "id": "kevano.local-ai-dashboard" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```


3. Restart or reload your Omarchy shell session.

## Service Architecture

### ollama — system instance

ollama is installed as a system-wide daemon (`/usr/lib/systemd/system/ollama.service`) that runs under a dedicated `ollama` user, stores models in `/usr/share/ollama`, and serves on a static port. The dashboard manages it via the **system** systemd instance using `pkexec` (which triggers a graphical polkit authentication prompt).

### llama.cpp — user instance

llama.cpp is designed as a flexible, developer-focused binary. Users frequently change parameter flags, swap local model files, adjust VRAM layer offloading, and edit preset `.ini` files. This per-user workflow aligns naturally with **user-scoped** systemd services.

When you toggle llama.cpp on for the first time, the plugin self-provisions both its configuration file (`configs/llama.env`) and its user service unit (`~/.config/systemd/user/llama.cpp.service`) automatically — no root privileges or polkit authentication required.

### Side-by-side operation

The two services live in separate systemd scopes (system vs. user instance), so they can run simultaneously without conflict. The dashboard's single-active enforcer handles switching between them when needed.

---

## Dependencies

The dashboard relies on standard Linux utilities to query local APIs and manage background units:

* `curl` and `jq` for API response handling.
* `systemd` (both system and user service instances).
* A polkit authentication agent for managing ollama's system-level service via `pkexec` (Omarchy ships one by default).
* `nvim` for inline file editing.
* Your preferred terminal emulator (e.g., `kitty`, `foot`) for log streaming.
